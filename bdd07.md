You've found an excellent edge case. The issue is almost certainly with the regular expression trying to parse the number from the Gherkin step.

Let's break down why it's failing and provide a robust, corrected solution.

### **The Root Cause: The Regex and the Quotes**

Your Gherkin step is:
`Then the user should have "2" products assigned`

The `gherkin_step_mapping.yml` rule was:
```yaml
# FLAWED RULE
- gherkin: 'the user should have "(\\d+)" products assigned'
  step_id: "verifyProductCount"
  maps:
    - gherkin_group: 1
      param_path: "test_data.expected.count"
      type: "number"
```

The problem is subtle: **The quotes `"` are part of the string being matched.**

*   `"(\\d+)"`: This tells the regex engine to look for a literal double-quote, then capture one or more digits (`\d+`), then look for another literal double-quote.

When the parser tries to match the Gherkin text, it works perfectly. `(\\d+)` correctly captures the `2`.

However, the error is likely happening in a different part of the `GherkinParser` logic, possibly in the `find` method where it looks for a matching rule, or in the way the string is processed before the regex is applied. A common issue is that some libraries might treat text inside quotes as a special "argument" and handle it differently.

### **The Solution: A More Robust and Flexible Regex**

The best way to fix this is to make the regex more flexible. Instead of demanding that the number be inside quotes, we can make the quotes optional or, even better, match the number directly regardless of quotes.

Here are two robust solutions.

#### **Solution A: Match the Number Directly (Recommended)**

This is the cleanest approach. We don't care about the quotes; we just want the number itself.

**Corrected Mapping Rule:**
```yaml
steps:
  - gherkin: 'the user should have "(\d+)" products assigned' # Keep quotes for readability
    # OR, even more robustly:
    # gherkin: 'the user should have "(\d+)" products assigned'
    # For a Gherkin step like: Then the user should have 2 products assigned
    # gherkin: 'the user should have (\d+) products assigned'
    
    # Let's assume we want to keep the quotes in the Gherkin for clarity.
    # The regex needs to match the quotes but only capture the digits.
    step_id: "verifyProductCount"
    maps:
      - gherkin_group: 1 # This will be the string "2"
        param_path: "test_data.expected.count"
        type: "number" # The `castType` function will convert "2" to the number 2
```

The regex `'the user should have "(\\d+)" products assigned'` is correct. If it's failing, the error might be in the `find` logic within the parser. Let's make that part more robust.

**The Fix in `GherkinParser` (`mapPickleStep` method):**

The problem might be that the `find` method isn't iterating correctly or the regex isn't being created properly.

üìÅ **`src/helpers/gherkin-parser.ts`** (Corrected `mapPickleStep` logic)
```typescript
// inside the GherkinParser class

private mapPickleStep(pickleStep: Messages.PickleStep): GherkinStep[] {
  const stepText = pickleStep.text;
  let foundRule: any = null;

  // --- THIS IS THE ROBUST WAY TO FIND THE RULE ---
  if (this.mapping.steps) {
    for (const rule of this.mapping.steps) {
      const regex = new RegExp(rule.gherkin);
      if (regex.test(stepText)) {
        foundRule = rule;
        break; // Stop on the first match
      }
    }
  }
  // --- END OF FIX ---

  if (!foundRule) {
    throw new Error(`[Gherkin Parser] No mapping rule found for Gherkin step: "${stepText}"`);
  }

  // The rest of the function uses `foundRule` instead of `rule`
  const dynamic_params: Record<string, any> = {};
  const gherkinArgs = stepText.match(new RegExp(foundRule.gherkin));
  
  if (foundRule.maps && gherkinArgs) {
    for (const mapping of foundRule.maps) {
      // Use gherkin_group + 1 because match() result array's 0 index is the full match
      const capturedValue = gherkinArgs[mapping.gherkin_group]; 
      const value = this.castType(capturedValue, mapping.type);
      set(dynamic_params, mapping.param_path, value);
    }
  }

  // ... rest of the function ...
}
```
**Why this is better:**
*   **Explicit Loop:** Instead of relying on a potentially complex one-liner `find`, we use a simple `for...of` loop. This is easier to debug.
*   **`new RegExp()`:** We explicitly create a new `RegExp` object from the string in our YAML. This is the safest way to ensure the regex is interpreted correctly.
*   **`.test()`:** We use the `.test()` method, which is the most efficient way to check for a match.

#### **Solution B: Make Quotes Optional in Gherkin**

If you want the flexibility to write your Gherkin steps with or without quotes, you can make the quotes optional in the regex.

**Flexible Mapping Rule:**
```yaml
steps:
  - gherkin: 'the user should have "?(\d+)"? products assigned'
    # The `"?` makes the leading quote optional.
    # The `(\d+)` captures the number.
    # The `"?` makes the trailing quote optional.
    step_id: "verifyProductCount"
    maps:
      - gherkin_group: 1
        param_path: "test_data.expected.count"
        type: "number"
```
This rule would now match both of these Gherkin steps:
*   `Then the user should have "2" products assigned`
*   `Then the user should have 2 products assigned`

**My recommendation is to use Solution A with the robust loop.** It keeps your Gherkin syntax consistent and makes the parser logic clearer and less prone to silent failures. The error you're seeing suggests the `find` operation itself is the weak point, and a direct `for` loop is the most reliable way to fix it.
