You have asked the perfect clarifying question, and it highlights a key improvement in the new design. My apologies if my previous explanation was not clear enough.

You are correct to be curious. The answer is: **We are still using the *logic* of those functions, but it has been centralized and merged into a single, more powerful function: `resolvePlaceholdersIn`.**

Let's break down the evolution:

**The Old Way (What we had before):**
*   We had a function called `resolveStepPlaceholders`.
*   Inside it, we would check if the payload was a file, load it, and then call *different* helper functions based on the content type:
    *   If it was JSON, we called `resolvePlaceholdersInObject`.
    *   If it was XML/text, we called `resolvePlaceholdersInString`.
*   This was slightly inefficient and meant the logic for placeholder replacement was spread across multiple functions.

**The New, Scalable Way (What we have now):**
*   We now have **one master resolver function**: `resolvePlaceholdersIn(data, context)`.
*   This function is "smart." It starts by checking the type of the `data` it receives.
    *   If `data` is an **array**, it maps over the array and calls itself on each item.
    *   If `data` is an **object**, it iterates over the object's properties and calls itself on each value.
    *   If `data` is a **string**, it performs the regex replacement for `{{...}}` placeholders.
    *   If `data` is a number or boolean, it returns it as-is.

**How does `test-executor.ts` use it now?**

The `resolveStepPlaceholders` function in the test executor is now much simpler. Its only job is to prepare the data and then hand it off to the master resolver.

Here's the key code block from the new `test-executor.ts`:

```typescript
// Inside `test-executor.ts`

// It IMPORTS the master resolver from the shared helper file
import { resolvePlaceholdersIn } from '@/helpers/placeholder-resolver'; 

async function resolveStepPlaceholders(step: FlowStep, flowContext: Record<string, any>, stepHistory: Record<string, any>): Promise<TestCase> {
  // 1. Make a copy of the step definition from the YAML
  const resolvedStep = JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(step)); 
  
  // 2. Create the context object for this run
  const context = { flow: flowContext, steps: stepHistory };

  // 3. If the payload points to a file, load that file's content
  //    and replace the file path string with the actual file content (as a JS object/string).
  if (typeof resolvedStep.payload === 'string' && resolvedStep.payload.startsWith('file://')) {
    const filePath = path.join(process.cwd(), resolvedStep.payload.replace('file://', ''));
    if (!fs.existsSync(filePath)) throw new Error(`Payload file not found: ${filePath}`);
    
    let fileContent = fs.readFileSync(filePath, 'utf8');
    // We parse it here so the resolver receives a native object or string
    resolvedStep.payload = tryParseJson(fileContent);
  }

  // 4. HERE IS THE KEY: We call the master resolver ONCE on the entire step object.
  // The master resolver handles traversing the endpoint string, the headers object,
  // and the entire (potentially nested) payload object automatically.
  return resolvePlaceholdersIn(resolvedStep, context);
}
```

**In summary:**

Instead of having separate `resolvePlaceholdersInString` and `resolvePlaceholdersInObject` functions *inside* `test-executor.ts`, we have combined their logic into the more powerful, recursive `resolvePlaceholdersIn` function, which now lives in the shared `src/helpers/placeholder-resolver.ts` module.

**Benefit of this approach:**
*   **Single Source of Truth:** All placeholder logic (`faker`, `dynamic`, `flow`, `steps`) is in one file. If you want to add a new placeholder type (e.g., `{{$config.someValue}}`), you only need to modify `placeholder-resolver.ts`.
*   **Consistency:** The standalone script (`generate-datafile.ts`) and the test executor (`test-executor.ts`) both use the *exact same resolver function*, guaranteeing that placeholders are replaced identically in both runtime and pre-generation scenarios.
*   **Simplicity:** The code in `test-executor.ts` is now simpler because it just delegates the complex task of resolution to the specialized helper module.
