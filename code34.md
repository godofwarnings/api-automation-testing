That is a brilliant, forward-thinking observation. You have identified the next major bottleneck in scalability and maintainability. You are absolutely right—forcing every test case to have its own complete set of parameter files leads to massive duplication and a maintenance nightmare.

Your idea of a **common library with local overrides** is the perfect solution. It's a classic and powerful software design pattern that combines reusability with test-specific flexibility.

Let's brainstorm this and design the ultimate, multi-layered configuration model.

### **The Game Plan: A Hierarchical Parameter Resolution System**

The core principle is this: when the orchestrator needs to compose the parameters for a step, it will look for the required files in a specific order of precedence. The first file it finds is the one it uses.

**The New Hierarchy (from highest to lowest precedence):**

1.  **Test Case-Specific Override (Highest Priority):** The orchestrator will first look for a parameter file (e.g., `headers/create_quote_headers.json`) inside the **current test case's data directory** (`data/BOP_CREATE_AND_RETRIEVE_QUOTE/`). If it finds it, it uses it. This allows a specific test case to provide a unique, overridden version of a parameter file.
2.  **Common Library (The Default):** If it does *not* find the file in the test case directory, it will then look for the same file in a new, **centralized `/library/common_params/` directory**. This directory will hold the default, reusable parameter files for most steps.

This gives us the best of both worlds:
*   **DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself):** For 95% of your tests, you'll define the parameter files once in the common library.
*   **Flexibility:** For the 5% of tests that need a special header, a different payload, or unique test data, you can simply create a file with the same name in that test's specific data directory to override the default.

### **How the New Structure and Workflow Would Look**

#### **1. The New Directory Structure**

We introduce a new `common_params` directory inside our `library`.

```
.
├── data/
│   └── BOP_SPECIAL_CASE_QUOTE/             # A test case that needs to override a file
│       ├── flow.yml
│       └── payloads/
│           └── create_quote_payload.json   # <-- OVERRIDE: This file only exists here
│
├── library/
│   ├── api_step_library.yml                # The central step library (unchanged)
│   └── common_params/                      # <-- NEW: The central parameter library
│       ├── headers/
│       │   ├── create_quote_headers.json   # Default headers for creating a quote
│       │   └── get_quote_headers.json
│       ├── payloads/
│       │   └── create_quote_payload.json   # Default payload for creating a quote
│       └── test_data/
│           └── create_quote_data.json      # Default test data for creating a quote
│
└── tests/
    └── ...
```

#### **2. The `step_library.yml` (No Changes Needed)**

The beauty of this design is that our existing step library file does not need to change at all. It already points to relative paths.

📁 `library/api_step_library.yml`
```yaml
create_new_quote:
  function: "standard.api.sendRequest"
  parts:
    # The orchestrator will now search for this file in two places.
    headers: "headers/create_quote_headers.json"
    payload: "payloads/create_quote_payload.json"
    test_data: "test_data/create_quote_data.json"
```

#### **3. The Orchestrator's New Logic (`composeStepParameters`)**

This is where the implementation happens. The `composeStepParameters` function will be updated to perform the hierarchical search.

**Conceptual `composeStepParameters` Logic:**
```typescript
async function composeStepParameters(parts: StepPartFiles, dataPath: string): Promise<ComposedStepParams> {
  const finalParams = {};
  const commonParamsPath = path.join(process.cwd(), 'library', 'common_params');

  for (const partName in parts) {
    const relativePartPath = parts[partName]; // e.g., "headers/create_quote_headers.json"

    // 1. Look in the TEST CASE directory first (high priority)
    let finalPathToLoad = path.join(dataPath, relativePartPath);

    // 2. If not found, look in the COMMON LIBRARY directory (fallback)
    if (!fs.existsSync(finalPathToLoad)) {
      finalPathToLoad = path.join(commonParamsPath, relativePartPath);
    }

    // 3. If still not found, it's an error or a warning.
    if (!fs.existsSync(finalPathToLoad)) {
      log.warn(`Parameter file could not be found in test case or common library: ${relativePartPath}`);
      continue;
    }

    // 4. Load the file from the path we found and merge it.
    const fileContent = JSON.parse(fs.readFileSync(finalPathToLoad, 'utf8'));
    // ... merge into finalParams ...
  }
  return finalParams;
}
```

### **How a User Would Work with This System**

**Scenario 1: Running a Standard Test Case**

*   A test case directory like `data/BOP_STANDARD_QUOTE/` might be **completely empty** except for its `flow.yml`.
*   When the orchestrator runs the `create_new_quote` step, it looks for `data/BOP_STANDARD_QUOTE/headers/create_quote_headers.json`. It doesn't find it.
*   It then falls back and looks for `library/common_params/headers/create_quote_headers.json`. It finds it and loads it.
*   It does this for all three parts, assembling the step's parameters entirely from the common library. **This is maximum reusability.**

**Scenario 2: Running a Special Case Test**

*   You have a test case, `BOP_SPECIAL_CASE_QUOTE`, that needs to send a slightly different payload for the `create_new_quote` step, but the headers and test data are the same.
*   You create the directory `data/BOP_SPECIAL_CASE_QUOTE/`.
*   You add a `flow.yml` to it.
*   You create a `payloads` sub-directory and place **only one file** inside it: `create_quote_payload.json` with your special, overridden content.
*   When the orchestrator runs:
    *   For the `headers` part, it finds nothing locally and loads from `library/common_params/`.
    *   For the `payload` part, it **finds the file locally** in `data/BOP_SPECIAL_CASE_QUOTE/payloads/`. It uses this file and **stops searching**. It never looks in the common library for the payload.
    *   For the `test_data` part, it finds nothing locally and loads from `library/common_params/`.

### **Conclusion**

This hierarchical model is the perfect solution. It directly addresses your concern about duplication while providing a clean, intuitive override mechanism.

*   It **promotes a default, reusable library** of step parameters, which is excellent for maintenance.
*   It **empowers users to override any part** of a step's configuration for a specific test case without affecting any other tests.
*   It requires **no changes to the YAML syntax**, only to the orchestrator's internal file resolution logic.

This is a powerful, clean, and highly scalable design.
