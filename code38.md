That is a classic and very tricky problem in any system that uses dot notation for object traversal. You are right to identify this as a potential point of failure. A key with a literal dot inside it will break a simple `path.split('.')` approach.

The solution is to introduce an **escape mechanism** in our path strings. We need a way to tell the `getValueFromObject` function: "Treat this specific dot as a literal character, not as a separator."

A common and intuitive convention for this is to use a backslash (`\`) as an escape character.

---

### **The Solution: Escaping Dots**

#### **1. The New YAML Syntax**

To access a key like `"customer.first"`, the user would write the path in their YAML like this:
```yaml
save_from_response:
  customerId: "Server.customer\\.first.id"
```
*   **`Server`**: The first key.
*   **`customer\\.first`**: This tells our parser to treat `"customer.first"` as a single key. The double backslash is necessary because a single backslash is an escape character in YAML strings itself.
*   **`id`**: The final key.

#### **2. The New, More Powerful `getValueFromObject`**

We need to replace our `path.split('.')` logic with a more intelligent parser that understands this escape syntax. A regular expression is the perfect tool for this. We will create a regex that can split a string by dots, but *ignore* dots that are preceded by a backslash.

Here is the new, robust implementation. This is the only function that needs to change.

üìÅ **`src/helpers/utils.ts`** (The Corrected `getValueFromObject` function)
```typescript
/**
 * A robust utility to extract a value from an object using a dot-notation path
 * that supports array querying AND escaped dots in keys.
 * @param obj The object to search within.
 * @param path The path string, e.g., "data.customer\\.first.id".
 */
export function getValueFromObject(obj: any, path: string): any {
  if (typeof obj !== 'object' || obj === null || typeof path !== 'string') {
    return undefined;
  }

  // --- NEW: Regex-based path splitting ---
  // This regex splits the path by dots, but not by escaped dots (e.g., "\.").
  // It uses a negative lookbehind `(?<!\\)` to ensure the dot is not preceded by a backslash.
  const pathSegments = path.split(/(?<!\\)\./g).map(segment => 
    // After splitting, we un-escape the dots that were preserved.
    segment.replace(/\\\./g, '.')
  );
  // --- END NEW ---

  let currentContext = obj;

  for (const segment of pathSegments) {
    if (currentContext === undefined) {
      return undefined;
    }
    
    // The array query logic can remain the same, but it now operates on a single segment.
    const arrayQueryRegex = /(\w+)\[(\w+)=([\w\d_-]+)\]/;
    const match = segment.match(arrayQueryRegex);

    if (match) {
      const [, arrayKey, queryField, queryValue] = match;
      const targetArray = currentContext[arrayKey];

      if (!Array.isArray(targetArray)) {
        log.warn(`[getValueFromObject] Path '${arrayKey}' did not resolve to an array for query.`);
        return undefined;
      }
      
      currentContext = targetArray.find(item =>
        item && typeof item === 'object' && String(item[queryField]) === queryValue
      );
    } else {
      // Standard key access on the current segment
      currentContext = currentContext[segment];
    }
  }

  return currentContext;
}

// NOTE: The previous iterative parser is now replaced by this more robust split-and-loop approach.
// The regex `(?<!\\)\.` is the key.
// `(?<!\\)` is a negative lookbehind. It asserts that the character immediately preceding the current location is not a `\`.
// `\.` matches a literal dot.
// So, it splits on any dot that is NOT preceded by a backslash.
```

### **How It Works: A Trace**

Let's trace your exact example: `Server.customer\\.first.id`

And assume the response body is:
```json
{
  "Server": {
    "customer.first": {
      "id": "user-12345"
    }
  }
}
```

1.  **`getValueFromObject` is called:** `getValueFromObject(responseBody, "Server.customer\\.first.id")`.
2.  **The New Regex Splitter Runs:**
    *   The string is `"Server.customer\\.first.id"`.
    *   The regex `/(?<!\\)\./g` looks for dots to split by.
    *   It finds the dot after `Server` (it's not preceded by `\`).
    *   It sees the dot in `customer\\.first` but **ignores it** because it *is* preceded by `\`.
    *   It finds the dot after `first` (it's not preceded by `\`).
    *   The `split()` result is `['Server', 'customer\\.first', 'id']`.
3.  **The `.map()` Runs:**
    *   The `map` function then iterates through this array to un-escape any `\.` sequences.
    *   `'Server'` -> `'Server'`
    *   `'customer\\.first'` -> `'customer.first'`
    *   `'id'` -> `'id'`
    *   The final `pathSegments` array is `['Server', 'customer.first', 'id']`.
4.  **The `for` Loop Runs:**
    *   **Loop 1:** `currentContext` becomes `responseBody['Server']`.
    *   **Loop 2:** `currentContext` becomes `currentContext['customer.first']` (which is `{ "id": "user-12345" }`). This works because we are now using the correct, complete key.
    *   **Loop 3:** `currentContext` becomes `currentContext['id']`.
5.  **Return Value:** The function correctly returns `"user-12345"`.

### **Summary of the Solution**

*   **Introduce an Escape Character:** We have defined the backslash (`\`) as the character to use when a key in your path contains a literal dot.
*   **Robust Parsing:** We replaced the simple `path.split('.')` with a more powerful regex-based splitter that understands and respects this escape rule.
*   **Clean YAML:** The user now has a clear and standard way to handle this edge case in their `save_from_response` and other placeholder paths.

This solution is robust, follows common conventions, and makes your `getValueFromObject` utility truly capable of handling complex, real-world object structures.
