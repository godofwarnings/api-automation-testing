Of course. These are excellent, practical features that give the user more control over the framework's behavior during test execution. We can easily implement both of these using a combination of `npm` scripts and environment variables.

Here is the game plan and the required code changes.

---

### **1. Cleaning Old Allure Reports**

This is a very common requirement to ensure that the generated report only contains data from the most recent run.

**The Solution:**
The `allure-playwright` command-line tool has a built-in `--clean` flag for exactly this purpose. We just need to add it to our `npm` script. To make it optional, we can create a new, separate script for it.

#### **Action: Update `package.json`**

We will modify our `report:allure` script and add a new `test:clean` script.

üìÅ **`package.json`** (Updated `scripts` section)
```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "// --- TEST EXECUTION ---": "",
    "test:bop:sit": "cross-env ENV=sit playwright test --project=bop-api-tests",
    
    "// --- REPORTING ---": "",
    "report:allure": "allure generate allure-results -o allure-report && allure open",
    "report:allure:clean": "allure generate allure-results -o allure-report --clean && allure open",

    "// --- UTILITY SCRIPTS ---": "",
    "clean": "rimraf allure-results allure-report test_downloads logs/.tmp",

    "// --- FULL WORKFLOW SCRIPT ---": "",
    "test:full:bop:sit": "npm run clean && npm run test:bop:sit && npm run report:allure:clean"
  }
}
```
*Self-correction:* We should also add a dedicated `clean` script to remove all generated artifacts for a truly fresh start. We'll use the `rimraf` package for cross-platform compatibility.

**New Dependency:**
```bash
npm install rimraf --save-dev
```

**How it works:**
*   **`report:allure`:** The original command. It generates a report *without* cleaning the `allure-results` directory. This can be useful if you want to accumulate results from multiple test runs into a single report.
*   **`report:allure:clean` (New):** This is the one you'll use most often. The `--clean` flag tells Allure to delete the contents of the `allure-report` directory before generating the new one, ensuring it's fresh.
*   **`clean` (New):** A powerful utility script that completely wipes all generated directories (`allure-results`, `allure-report`, `test_downloads`, `logs`, `.tmp`). This is perfect for running before a CI job.
*   **`test:full:bop:sit` (New):** An example of how to chain these commands together for a complete, clean test run from start to finish.

### **2. Optional Emailing via Environment Variable**

This is a crucial feature for controlling notifications. You don't want an email every time you run tests locally, but you always want one from the nightly Jenkins run.

**The Solution:**
We will use an environment variable, `SEND_EMAIL`, to act as a switch. The `global.teardown.ts` script will check for the presence and value of this variable before attempting to send any email.

#### **Action: Update `global.teardown.ts`**

We will add a check at the very beginning of the teardown script.

üìÅ **`tests/global.teardown.ts`** (Updated)
```typescript
import { FullConfig } from '@playwright/test/reporter';
import { sendNotificationEmail, MailAttachment } from '../src/helpers/mailer';
import { log } from '../src/helpers/logger';
// ... other imports

async function globalTeardown(config: FullConfig) {
  log.info('--- Starting Global Teardown ---');

  // --- NEW: Check for the email flag ---
  if (process.env.SEND_EMAIL !== 'true') {
    log.info("SEND_EMAIL flag is not 'true'. Skipping email notification.");
    log.info('--- Global Teardown Complete (No Email Sent) ---');
    return; // Exit the teardown script early
  }
  // --- END NEW ---

  // The rest of the script will only execute if SEND_EMAIL is 'true'
  const runId = process.env.RUN_ID;
  if (!runId) {
    log.error("Teardown Error: RUN_ID not found. Cannot generate report.");
    return;
  }
  
  const recipients = process.env.EMAIL_RECIPIENTS;
  if (!recipients) {
    log.warn("EMAIL_RECIPIENTS not set, but SEND_EMAIL was true. Cannot send email.");
    return;
  }
  
  // ... (All logic for reading stats, composing HTML, and sending the email remains the same)
  
  log.info('--- Global Teardown Complete (Email Sent) ---');
}

export default globalTeardown;
```

#### **How to Use It**

Now you have complete control from your `npm` scripts in `package.json`.

**Example `package.json` scripts:**

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "// --- LOCAL RUN (NO EMAIL) ---": "",
    "test:local:bop": "cross-env LOG_TO_FILE=true ENV=sit PARTNER=partner_a playwright test --project=bop-api-tests",

    "// --- CI RUN (WITH EMAIL) ---": "",
    "test:ci:bop": "cross-env SEND_EMAIL=true LOG_TO_FILE=true ENV=sit PARTNER=partner_a playwright test --project=bop-api-tests",
    
    "// --- FULL CI WORKFLOW EXAMPLE ---": "",
    "ci:run": "npm run clean && npm run test:ci:bop"
  }
}
```

**Workflow:**
*   When a developer runs `npm run test:local:bop`, the `SEND_EMAIL` variable is not set. The teardown script will start, see the flag is not `'true'`, log a message, and exit immediately.
*   When Jenkins (or any CI server) runs `npm run test:ci:bop`, it uses `cross-env` to set `SEND_EMAIL=true`. Now, the teardown script will execute its full logic, generate the report, and send the notification email.

This provides a clean, simple, and powerful switch to control notifications, perfectly suited for both local development and CI/CD environments.
