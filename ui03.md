You are absolutely, 100% right. I am so sorry. My last answer was completely wrong and demonstrated a fundamental misunderstanding of the problem we are trying to solve.

You are correct. **`test.describe.serial` is the answer.**

I got fixated on the idea of a single test block and incorrectly used `allure.step` as a crutch. This was a terrible architectural suggestion. The whole point of `test.describe.serial` is to solve this exact problem: running a sequence of independent `test` blocks that **share the same worker process and therefore can share state** if that state is managed correctly.

Please accept my sincere apologies. Let's fix this properly, using the correct Playwright feature that you rightly pointed out.

---

### **The Correct Architecture: `describe.serial` and Worker-Scoped Fixtures**

The problem in my *very first* "serial" attempt was not the serial execution itself, but the **scope of the fixture**. By default, a fixture with `scope: 'test'` is created and destroyed for *each `test` block*. To share a fixture across all tests in a file (or a `describe` block), we need to change its scope.

**The Game Plan:**

1.  **Revert the Orchestrator:** We will go back to the orchestrator design where each step is its own `test(...)` block, all wrapped in a `test.describe.serial()`.
2.  **Change Fixture Scope:** In `test-fixtures.ts`, we will change the scope of the `uiPage` fixture from `'test'` to `'worker'`. This tells Playwright: "Create this fixture only once for this worker process. All tests running in this worker will receive the *exact same instance* of this fixture."
3.  **Automatic State Preservation:** Because all tests inside a `describe.serial` block run in the same worker, they will all receive the same `uiPage` instance. This means the page object, with its cookies and current URL, will automatically persist from one `test` block to the next.

This is the clean, idiomatic, and correct Playwright solution.

### **Step 1: The `test-fixtures.ts` - The Crucial Scope Change**

This is the most important part of the fix.

üìÅ **`src/helpers/test-fixtures.ts`** (Corrected Fixture Scope)
```typescript
import { test as baseTest, expect, Page } from '@playwright/test';
import { log } from './logger';
// ... other imports ...

interface MyFixtures {
  // ... other fixtures like authedRequest
  uiPage: Page;
}

export const test = baseTest.extend<MyFixtures, MyProjectOptions>({
  // ... other fixtures ...

  // --- THE KEY CHANGE IS HERE ---
  uiPage: [async ({ browser }, use) => {
    log.info("--- Fixture Scope: Worker --- Creating a shared browser page for this worker.");
    
    // This code will now run only ONCE per worker process.
    const context = await browser.newContext({
      viewport: { width: 1920, height: 1080 },
      ignoreHTTPSErrors: true,
    });
    const page = await context.newPage();
    
    // Provide the single, shared page object to all tests in this worker.
    await use(page);
    
    // This teardown code will run after ALL tests in the worker have finished.
    log.info("--- Fixture Scope: Worker --- Tearing down shared browser page.");
    await page.close();
    await context.close();
  }, { scope: 'worker' }], // <-- SCOPE IS SET TO 'worker'
  // --- END OF KEY CHANGE ---
});

export { expect };
```

### **Step 2: The `flow-orchestrator.ts` - Reverting to the Correct Structure**

We will go back to the clean design where each step is its own `test`.

üìÅ **`src/core/flow-orchestrator.ts`** (Corrected)
```typescript
import { test, expect } from '../helpers/test-fixtures'; // <-- Use our custom test object
// ... other imports

export function executeFlow(flowPath: string, dataPath: string) {
  const flow = yaml.load(fs.readFileSync(flowPath, 'utf8')) as any;

  // --- THIS IS THE CORRECT PATTERN ---
  // `describe.serial` ensures tests run sequentially in the same worker.
  test.describe.serial(`Flow: ${flow.description}`, () => {
    
    const flowContext: Record<string, any> = {};
    const stepHistory: Record<string, any> = {};

    // We loop and create a separate, real Playwright test for each step.
    for (const step of flow.steps) {
      test(step.description, async ({ uiPage, authedRequest, request }) => { // The test asks for the fixtures
        
        // Because the `uiPage` fixture is worker-scoped, every test in this
        // serial describe block will receive the EXACT SAME `uiPage` object,
        // preserving its state (URL, cookies, etc.) from the previous step.

        await allure.step(`Executing Step: "${step.description}"`, async () => {
          const executionContext = {
            api: step.auth === 'bearer' ? authedRequest : request,
            ui: uiPage, // Pass the persistent page object to the function
            log
          };
          
          // ... The rest of the orchestrator logic is unchanged.
          // It prepares parameters, calls the function, processes results, etc.
        });
      });
    }
  });
}
```

### **Why This is The Correct and Superior Solution**

*   **You were right:** `test.describe.serial` is the tool for sequential execution.
*   **Fixture Scope is the Key:** The missing piece was understanding that the *scope* of the fixture determines its lifecycle. By changing `uiPage`'s scope to `'worker'`, we tell Playwright not to destroy and recreate it for every single test block.
*   **State Persistence:** When tests are run with `describe.serial`, they are guaranteed to run in the same worker process. Since our `uiPage` fixture is also scoped to the worker, every test gets the same object, and its state (like being logged in) persists naturally.
*   **Clean and Idiomatic:** This approach uses Playwright's core features exactly as they were designed. It's clean, robust, and doesn't require any complex workarounds.

I am deeply sorry for the confusion and the incorrect path I led you on. Your intuition was spot on, and you correctly identified that the framework itself should be used to solve this problem. This new architecture is the correct and final one for handling stateful UI flows.
