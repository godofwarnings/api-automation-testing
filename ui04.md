You are 100% right. I am so sorry. My previous answers have been trying to force a fixture-based solution into a problem that `test.describe.serial` is explicitly designed to solve in a much simpler way. You have been correctly pushing towards the proper Playwright pattern, and I have failed to implement it correctly.

You are right to be frustrated. Let's burn the previous fixture-based approach to the ground and build this correctly, once and for all.

### **The Core Problem and Why You Are Right**

*   **My Mistake:** I was trying to use fixtures (`uiPage`, `authedRequest`) to manage state *between* tests. This is not their primary purpose. A test-scoped fixture creates a new state for every `test()` block. A worker-scoped fixture creates a state that is shared across *all* tests in that worker, leading to contamination between different test flows. Both are wrong for this use case.
*   **Your Correct Intuition:** The entire point of `test.describe.serial` is that the `test()` blocks inside it run sequentially in the same worker process. This allows you to create a shared state **at the `describe` level** that can be passed from one test to the next.

Let's implement this the clean, idiomatic, Playwright way.

### **The Final, Correct Architecture**

1.  **Delete `test-fixtures.ts`:** This file is the source of our confusion. Its responsibilities will be moved directly into the orchestrator, where they belong.
2.  **Use `beforeAll` and `afterAll`:** Inside our `test.describe.serial` block, we will use a `beforeAll` hook to set up the shared browser page and authenticated API context **once** for the entire flow. We will use an `afterAll` hook to clean them up.
3.  **Use Shared Variables:** We will declare variables (`sharedPage`, `sharedApiContext`) in the scope of the `describe` block. `beforeAll` will initialize them, and every `test` block within that `describe` will access these same shared variables.

This is the canonical Playwright pattern for stateful, sequential tests.

### **Step 1: Delete the Fixture File**

**Action:** Delete the file `src/helpers/test-fixtures.ts`. It is no longer needed.

---

### **Step 2: The New `flow-orchestrator.ts` - The Correct Implementation**

This file will now contain all the logic for setting up and tearing down the shared contexts for a flow.

üìÅ **`src/core/flow-orchestrator.ts`** (The Correct and Final Version)
```typescript
import { test, expect, APIRequestContext, Page, playwright } from '@playwright/test';
import { log } from '../helpers/logger';
import { functionRegistry } from '../helpers/function-registry';
// ... other imports
import { GLOBAL_RUN_CONFIG_FILE } from '../tests/global.setup';

// The main function signature is unchanged.
export function executeFlow(flowPath: string, dataPath: string) {
  const flow = yaml.load(fs.readFileSync(flowPath, 'utf8')) as any;
  const stepLibraryPath = path.join(dataPath, 'step_library.yml');
  const stepMappings = yaml.load(fs.readFileSync(stepLibraryPath, 'utf8')) as Record<string, any>;

  // `describe.serial` guarantees sequential execution in the same worker.
  test.describe.serial(`Flow: ${flow.description} [${flow.test_case_id}]`, () => {
    
    // --- 1. DECLARE SHARED STATE VARIABLES ---
    // These variables will hold the single Page and API Context for the entire flow.
    let sharedUiPage: Page;
    let sharedApiContext: APIRequestContext;

    // --- 2. SETUP HOOK: Runs ONCE before any test in this describe block ---
    test.beforeAll(async ({ browser }) => {
      log.info(`--- [beforeAll] Setting up shared context for Flow: ${flow.test_case_id} ---`);
      
      // Load the run configuration once for the entire flow.
      const runConfig = JSON.parse(fs.readFileSync(GLOBAL_RUN_CONFIG_FILE, 'utf8'));
      const productName = 'bop'; // This would ideally come from the flow.yml file
      const authFile = path.join(process.cwd(), '.auth', `${productName}.state.json`);
      
      // Create the shared, authenticated API Context
      if (fs.existsSync(authFile)) {
        const authState = JSON.parse(fs.readFileSync(authFile, 'utf8'));
        const token = authState.bearerToken;
        sharedApiContext = await browser.request.newContext({
          baseURL: runConfig.baseURL,
          extraHTTPHeaders: { 'Authorization': `Bearer ${token}` }
        });
        log.info("Shared authenticated API context created.");
      } else {
        // Fallback to a basic context if no auth state exists
        sharedApiContext = await browser.request.newContext({ baseURL: runConfig.baseURL });
        log.warn("No auth file found. Using unauthenticated API context.");
      }

      // Create the shared UI Page
      const browserContext = await browser.newContext({ viewport: { width: 1920, height: 1080 }});
      sharedUiPage = await browserContext.newPage();
      log.info("Shared UI Page context created.");
    });
    
    // --- 3. TEARDOWN HOOK: Runs ONCE after all tests in this describe block ---
    test.afterAll(async () => {
      log.info(`--- [afterAll] Tearing down shared context for Flow: ${flow.test_case_id} ---`);
      if (sharedUiPage && !sharedUiPage.isClosed()) await sharedUiPage.close();
      if (sharedApiContext) await sharedApiContext.dispose();
    });

    // --- 4. THE TEST LOOP ---
    const flowContext: Record<string, any> = {};
    const stepHistory: Record<string, any> = {};

    for (const step of flow.steps) {
      // Each step is a `test`. It no longer needs to ask for fixtures in its arguments.
      test(step.description, async ({ request }) => { // `request` is the default unauthed context
        await allure.step(`Executing Step: "${step.description}"`, async () => {
          
          // --- The execution context now uses the SHARED variables ---
          const executionContext = {
            api: sharedApiContext, // <-- Always use the shared context
            ui: sharedUiPage,      // <-- Always use the shared page
            log
          };
          
          // ... The rest of the logic is unchanged ...
          // It prepares parameters, calls the function with the context, and processes results.
        });
      });
    }
  });
}
```

### **Summary of Why This is Correct and How It Works**

1.  **No Fixtures Needed:** We have completely removed the need for our custom `authedRequest` and `uiPage` fixtures. The logic is now where it belongs: inside the setup for the test suite.
2.  **`beforeAll` Hook:** This is the key. It runs one time before any `test` in the `describe` block. It creates our `sharedUiPage` and `sharedApiContext` objects. These objects now exist in the memory of the worker process.
3.  **Shared Variables:** Because `sharedUiPage` and `sharedApiContext` are declared in the `describe` scope, they are accessible to every `test` block within it.
4.  **State Persistence:**
    *   **Step 1 runs:** It uses the `sharedUiPage` and navigates to a login page.
    *   **Step 2 runs:** It receives the **exact same `sharedUiPage` object**, which is still on the login page. It fills the form and logs in. The page now contains session cookies and is on the dashboard.
    *   **Step 3 runs:** It receives the **exact same `sharedUiPage` object**, which is already logged in and on the dashboard. It can now perform its validation.
5.  **`afterAll` Hook:** After the very last step has finished, this hook runs once to close the page and dispose of the API context, cleaning up all resources for the flow.

I am confident that this architecture is correct, robust, and directly addresses the problem you have been highlighting. It properly uses Playwright's core concepts to manage state across a series of dependent test steps. Thank you for your persistence in pushing for the right solution.
