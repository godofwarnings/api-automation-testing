You have found a critical flaw in the `generateRepeat` function. You are absolutely right. My previous implementation incorrectly assumed that `count` would always be a simple number. It has no logic to handle a placeholder like `{{$parent.item}}`.

I sincerely apologize for this oversight. It's a bug that completely breaks the nested generation feature. Let's fix this immediately with a more robust implementation.

---

### **The Root Cause: Resolving `count` Too Late**

The problem is here:
```typescript
// FLAWED LOGIC
function generateRepeat(config: any, context: any): any[] {
  let count = config.count || 0; // This gets the raw value, e.g., "{{$parent.item}}"
  // ...
  for (let i = 0; i < count; i++) { // The loop fails because count is not a number
    // ...
  }
}
```
The loop `for (let i = 0; i < "{{$parent.item}}"; i++)` makes no sense. We need to **resolve the placeholder in the `count` property** before we try to use it as the loop's limit.

---

### **The Corrected Code: `placeholder-resolver.ts`**

We will update the `generateRepeat` function to be "context-aware." It will now resolve any placeholders in its own configuration *before* it starts its logic.

📁 **`src/helpers/placeholder-resolver.ts`** (The Corrected `generateRepeat` function)
```typescript
/**
 * Generates an array of objects by repeating a template.
 * This version correctly resolves placeholders in its own 'count' property.
 */
function generateRepeat(config: any, context: any): any[] {
  const results = [];
  let count = 0; // Default to 0

  // --- NEW, ROBUST LOGIC FOR DETERMINING COUNT ---
  if (config.count) {
    // If 'count' is a placeholder string, resolve it.
    if (typeof config.count === 'string') {
      // We call the main resolver on the count value itself.
      // This will resolve {{...}} placeholders.
      const resolvedCount = resolvePlaceholdersIn(config.count, context);
      count = Number(resolvedCount);
    } else {
      // If it's already a number, just use it.
      count = Number(config.count);
    }
  } else if (config.count_from) {
    // If using 'count_from', resolve the path to get the source array.
    const sourceArray = resolvePlaceholdersIn(config.count_from, context);
    if (Array.isArray(sourceArray)) {
      count = sourceArray.length;
    }
  }
  // --- END OF NEW LOGIC ---

  // Validate the final count
  if (isNaN(count) || count <= 0) {
    log.warn({ config, resolvedCount: count }, "Repeat generator count is zero or invalid. Returning empty array.");
    return [];
  }
  log.debug(`Repeat generator will create ${count} item(s).`);
  
  const sourceArray = config.count_from ? resolvePlaceholdersIn(config.count_from, context) : null;

  for (let i = 0; i < count; i++) {
    // Create the enriched context for this specific iteration
    const iterationContext = {
      ...context,
      $index: i,
      $index_1: i + 1,
      $parent: {
        ...(context.$parent || {}),
        item: sourceArray ? sourceArray[i] : null,
        $index: context.$index,
        $index_1: context.$index_1,
      }
    };
    
    // Recursively call the main resolver on the template object
    results.push(resolvePlaceholdersIn(config.template, iterationContext));
  }

  return results;
}

// All other functions in this file (resolvePlaceholdersIn, executeGenerator, etc.)
// remain unchanged. This fix is isolated to `generateRepeat`.
```

### **How the Fix Works: A Trace**

Let's trace the execution for the nested `buildings` generator from our previous example.

1.  **Outer Loop (Locations):** The `generateRepeat` for `locations` starts. Let's say it's on its first iteration (`$index = 0`). The `context` object for this iteration contains `$parent.item` which has the value `3` (from our `[3, 2, 5]` array).
2.  **`resolvePlaceholdersIn` Traverses:** The main resolver is called on the `locations` template. It reaches the `buildings` key:
    ```json
    "buildings": {
      "$generate": {
        "type": "repeat",
        "count": "{{$parent.item}}", // <-- The value is a string
        "template": { ... }
      }
    }
    ```
3.  **Generator Triggered:** The resolver sees `$generate` and calls `executeGenerator`, which in turn calls our **new and improved `generateRepeat`** for the `buildings`.
4.  **`generateRepeat` for Buildings Runs:**
    *   It sees `config.count` has the value `"{{$parent.item}}"`.
    *   It enters the `if (typeof config.count === 'string')` block.
    *   It calls `resolvePlaceholdersIn("{{$parent.item}}", context)`.
    *   The resolver looks up `$parent.item` in the current `context` and finds the value `3`.
    *   `resolvedCount` becomes `3`.
    *   `count` is set to `Number(3)`, which is `3`.
    *   The `for` loop now correctly runs from `i = 0` to `2`.
    *   Three building objects are generated and returned.

This corrected logic ensures that the parameters for a generator are themselves resolved before the generator tries to use them, making nested and context-aware data generation work perfectly. Thank you for catching this critical bug.
