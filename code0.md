You are absolutely right to call that out. I made a mistake in the previous example by merging the "headers" information into a new, confusing `request_params` folder. That was a poor choice that muddied the clean, composable design we are aiming for.

My apologies. Let's correct this immediately with a much clearer and more logical structure.

---

### **The Corrected Architecture: The "Three Parts of a Request"**

A standard API request is composed of three distinct parts:
1.  **The "How":** The endpoint, method, and headers.
2.  **The "What":** The payload or body.
3.  **The "Why":** The test-specific data used for placeholders and assertions.

Our file structure should reflect this clean separation.

---

### **The Corrected Directory and File Structure**

Here is the revised, correct structure. We will get rid of the `request_params` folder and bring back the `headers` folder.

```
data/
└── BOP_CREATE_AND_RETRIEVE_QUOTE/
    ├── flow.yml                          # The master script for this test case
    ├── headers/                          # <-- The headers file, containing endpoint, method, and headers
    │   ├── create_quote_headers.json
    │   └── get_quote_headers.json
    ├── payloads/
    │   └── create_quote_payload.json     # <-- The payload/body for the request
    └── test_data/
        ├── create_quote_data.json        # <-- Test-specific data and assertions
        └── get_quote_data.json
```

---

### **The Corrected File Contents**

Let's define what goes into each file.

#### **1. The Step Library (`step_library.yml`)**

This file now correctly points to the three distinct "parts" of the request.

📁 `data/BOP_CREATE_AND_RETRIEVE_QUOTE/step_library.yml` (Corrected)
```yaml
# This library defines the reusable steps available for this test case.
create_new_quote:
  description: "Create a new BOP Quote with dynamic data"
  function: "standard.api.sendRequest"
  # The three distinct parts of the request configuration
  parts:
    headers: "headers/create_quote_headers.json"
    payload: "payloads/create_quote_payload.json"
    test_data: "test_data/create_quote_data.json"
  save_from_response:
    savedQuoteId: "data.quoteId"

get_quote_by_id:
  description: "Retrieve the quote created in the previous step"
  function: "standard.api.sendRequest"
  parts:
    # This GET request only needs headers and test_data
    headers: "headers/get_quote_headers.json"
    test_data: "test_data/get_quote_data.json"
```

#### **2. The `headers` File**

This file now contains **only** the information related to the request's endpoint, method, and headers. The `request_params` folder is gone.

📁 `data/BOP_CREATE_AND_RETRIEVE_QUOTE/headers/create_quote_headers.json` (Corrected)
```json
{
  "endpoint": "/v1/quotes",
  "method": "POST",
  "headers": {
    "Content-Type": "application/json"
  },
  "contextual_headers": [
    {
      "key": "X-Transaction-ID",
      "sourcePath": "$dynamic.uuid"
    }
  ]
}
```

#### **3. The `payloads` and `test_data` Files**

These files remain exactly as they were in the previous correct example.

*   **`payloads/create_quote_payload.json`:** Contains the request body, with placeholders like `{{testData.product}}` and `{{faker.person.firstName}}`.
*   **`test_data/create_quote_data.json`:** Contains the test-specific data to populate the placeholders and the `expected` block for assertions.

---

### **How the Orchestrator Will Work Now**

The conceptual logic in the `flow-orchestrator` is now much cleaner:

1.  **Start Step:** It begins the `create_new_quote` step.
2.  **Look at `parts`:** It sees that this step requires `headers`, `payload`, and `test_data`.
3.  **Load Files:** It loads the three corresponding JSON files from the `data/BOP_CREATE_AND_RETRIEVE_QUOTE/` subdirectories.
4.  **Merge into `params`:** It performs a deep merge of these three objects into a single `params` object that will be passed to the function. The structure would look like this in memory:
    ```javascript
    const params = {
      // From headers.json
      "endpoint": "/v1/quotes",
      "method": "POST",
      "headers": { "Content-Type": "application/json" },
      "contextual_headers": [ ... ],
      // From payload.json
      "payload": {
        "productCode": "{{testData.product}}",
        "policyHolder": { "firstName": "{{faker.person.firstName}}", ... }
      },
      // From test_data.json
      "test_data": {
        "product": "BOP_SPECIALTY"
      },
      "expected": {
        "status": 201,
        "body": { "should_contain_key": "data.quoteId" }
      }
    };
    ```
5.  **Resolve and Execute:** It then proceeds with the placeholder resolution and function execution as planned.

This corrected structure is much more logical and intuitive. It clearly separates the three fundamental components of any API test step, making the framework easier to understand and use. Thank you for catching my mistake and enforcing a cleaner design.
