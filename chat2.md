This is an excellent and crucial requirement for any serious API testing framework. You've perfectly described the need for **test chaining** and **end-to-end flow testing**. A single API call is rarely useful on its own; value comes from simulating a full business process.

We will achieve this by introducing a new concept in our YAML definitions: a **"flow"**. A flow is a sequence of API calls (steps) that must be executed in order, where data from one step can be used in subsequent steps.

This is a significant enhancement. Here is the plan and the updated code.

---

### **The Architectural Plan: How to Achieve Chaining**

1.  **New YAML Structure (`flow`):** We will create a new way to define tests for end-to-end flows. Instead of a simple list of test cases, a file can now define a `flow` with an array of `steps`.

2.  **`test.describe.serial()`:** To guarantee the execution order, we will wrap the entire flow in Playwright's `test.describe.serial()`. This ensures each step runs sequentially in the same worker process.

3.  **Flow Context:** We'll introduce a `flowContext` object at the start of each flow. This object will act as a temporary storage for data that needs to be passed between steps.

4.  **Enhanced Placeholders:** Our placeholder syntax `{{...}}` will be made more powerful to access this new context:
    *   `{{flow.variableName}}`: To get a value saved from a previous step's **response**.
    *   `{{steps.step_id.request.body.path}}`: A new syntax to access the **request payload** of a previous step.

5.  **New Test Executor:** We will create a new function, `executeApiFlows`, in our `test-executor.ts` to handle this new flow structure. The old `executeApiTests` can remain for simple, non-chained tests.

---

### **Step 1: The New YAML `flow` Schema**

Here is an example of what a new end-to-end test definition file will look like. Imagine this file is named `create_and_retrieve_quote.flow.yml`.

üìÅ `tests/products/bop/flows/create_and_retrieve_quote.flow.yml` (New file)
```yaml
flow_id: "BOP_E2E_QUOTE_RETRIEVAL"
description: "Full workflow to create a quote and then retrieve it"

steps:
  - step_id: "create_quote_step" # A unique ID to reference this step later
    description: "Step 1: Create a new quote with valid data"
    endpoint: "/post" # Using httpbin.org/post
    method: "POST"
    auth: "bearer"
    headers:
      Content-Type: "application/json"
    payload:
      file://templates/bop/createQuote_base.json # Assume this has {{petName}}
    
    # New section: what to save from the response of this step
    save_from_response:
      # Save the 'id' from the response body into a flow variable called 'createdQuoteId'
      createdQuoteId: "json.id" 
      # Save the name we sent, but from the echoed response, into 'createdPetName'
      createdPetName: "json.name"

  - step_id: "retrieve_quote_step"
    description: "Step 2: Retrieve the newly created quote using its ID"
    # Use the variable saved from the previous step in the URL
    endpoint: "/get?quoteId={{flow.createdQuoteId}}" # Using httpbin.org/get
    method: "GET"
    auth: "bearer"
    # No payload for GET request

  - step_id: "update_quote_step"
    description: "Step 3: Update the quote, reusing data from the original request"
    endpoint: "/put" # Using httpbin.org/put
    method: "PUT"
    auth: "bearer"
    headers:
      Content-Type: "application/json"
    payload:
      quoteId: "{{flow.createdQuoteId}}" # Use a variable from a previous response
      # New concept: Use data from a PREVIOUS REQUEST's payload
      petNameWas: "{{steps.create_quote_step.request.body.name}}"
      newStatus: "sold"
```

### **Step 2: Update the Test Executor with `executeApiFlows`**

This is the core of the new functionality. We will add a new exported function to `test-executor.ts` and several new helper functions.

üìÅ **`src/core/test-executor.ts`** (Additions and new functions)
```typescript
// --- Add these imports at the top ---
import { test, expect } from '@/helpers/test-fixtures';
import { get } from 'http';
// ... other imports

// --- Keep all existing code (interfaces, executeApiTests, sendRequest, etc.) ---
// ...

// --- NEW: Type Definitions for Flows ---
interface FlowStep extends TestCase {
  step_id: string;
  save_from_response?: Record<string, string>;
}

interface ApiFlow {
  flow_id: string;
  description: string;
  steps: FlowStep[];
}

// --- NEW: Main Executor for Flows ---
export function executeApiFlows(flowYamlPath: string) {
  if (!fs.existsSync(flowYamlPath)) {
    throw new Error(`FATAL: Flow definition file not found: ${flowYamlPath}`);
  }
  
  const flow: ApiFlow = yaml.load(fs.readFileSync(flowYamlPath, 'utf8')) as ApiFlow;
  if (!flow || !flow.flow_id || !Array.isArray(flow.steps)) {
    throw new Error(`Invalid flow structure in ${flowYamlPath}`);
  }

  // Use test.describe.serial to GUARANTEE sequential execution
  test.describe.serial(`API Flow: ${flow.description}`, () => {
    const flowContext: Record<string, any> = {}; // Holds variables like {{flow.createdQuoteId}}
    const stepHistory: Record<string, { request: any, response: any }> = {}; // Holds past request/response bodies

    for (const step of flow.steps) {
      test(step.description, async ({ request, authedRequest }) => {
        const apiRequest = step.auth === 'bearer' ? authedRequest : request;

        // 1. Resolve placeholders in the current step's definition
        const resolvedStep = resolvePlaceholders(step, flowContext, stepHistory);

        // 2. Send the request using the existing helper
        const response = await sendRequest(apiRequest, resolvedStep);
        const responseBody = response.ok() ? await tryParseJson(await response.text()) : null;

        // 3. Save the request and response to history for future steps
        stepHistory[step.step_id] = {
            request: (resolvedStep.payload) ? await tryParseJson(resolvedStep.payload) : null,
            response: responseBody
        };

        // 4. Save values from the response to the flow context for the next step
        if (response.ok() && step.save_from_response) {
            processSaveFromResponse(responseBody, step.save_from_response, flowContext);
        }

        // 5. Run assertions (if you add an 'expected' block to your flow steps)
        // For now, we just check that the request was successful
        expect(response.ok(), `API call for step '${step.description}' failed with status ${response.status()}`).toBeTruthy();
      });
    }
  });
}

// --- NEW: Helper Functions for Chaining ---

/**
 * Replaces all placeholders in a step's endpoint and payload.
 */
function resolvePlaceholders(step: FlowStep, flowContext: Record<string, any>, stepHistory: Record<string, any>): FlowStep {
  const resolvedStep = JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(step)); // Deep copy to avoid modifying original
  let stepString = JSON.stringify(resolvedStep);

  const placeholderRegex = /\{\{([\w\.]*)\}\}/g;
  stepString = stepString.replace(placeholderRegex, (match, placeholderPath) => {
    let value: any;
    if (placeholderPath.startsWith('flow.')) {
      value = getValueFromObject(flowContext, placeholderPath.substring(5));
    } else if (placeholderPath.startsWith('steps.')) {
      value = getValueFromObject(stepHistory, placeholderPath.substring(6));
    }
    
    if (value === undefined) {
      console.warn(`Placeholder '{{${placeholderPath}}}' could not be resolved. It will be replaced with an empty string.`);
      return "";
    }

    // If we're replacing a value in a JSON string, we need to be careful.
    // If the placeholder was the *entire* value (e.g., "payload": "{{flow.someObject}}"),
    // we don't want to wrap the resolved object in quotes. This is a complex problem.
    // For now, we'll just do a simple string replacement.
    // A more robust solution might use a recursive object traversal.
    return String(value);
  });
  
  return JSON.parse(stepString);
}

/**
 * Extracts values from a response and saves them to the flow context.
 */
function processSaveFromResponse(responseBody: any, rules: Record<string, string>, flowContext: Record<string, any>) {
  if (!responseBody) return;
  allure.step('[Chaining] Saving variables from response', async () => {
    for (const [variableName, jsonPath] of Object.entries(rules)) {
      const value = getValueFromObject(responseBody, jsonPath);
      if (value !== undefined) {
        flowContext[variableName] = value;
        await allure.attachment(`${variableName} Saved`, String(value), { contentType: 'text/plain' });
      } else {
        console.warn(`Could not find path '${jsonPath}' in response to save as '${variableName}'.`);
      }
    }
  });
}

// You will also need this helper if it's not already in the file
function getValueFromObject(obj: any, path: string): any {
  return path.split('.').reduce((o, key) => (o && o[key] !== undefined ? o[key] : undefined), obj);
}
```
*Note: The `resolvePlaceholders` function provided uses a simple string replace. This works well for URLs and simple values but can be tricky if you try to substitute an entire JSON object into a payload. A more advanced version would recursively traverse the payload object.*

### **Step 3: Create a "Glue" Spec File for the Flow**

Finally, create a new spec file that calls our new `executeApiFlows` function.

üìÅ `tests/products/bop/specs/e2e_quote.spec.ts` (New file)
```typescript
import { executeApiFlows } from '@/core/test-executor';
import * as path from 'path';

const flowPath = path.join('tests', 'products', 'bop', 'flows', 'create_and_retrieve_quote.flow.yml');

executeApiFlows(flowPath);
```

### **How to Run It**

Your existing npm scripts will work perfectly. When you run `npm run test:bop:httpbin`, Playwright will now pick up `e2e_quote.spec.ts`, which will execute the new flow logic.

1.  It will run the `create_quote_step`.
2.  The `processSaveFromResponse` function will see `save_from_response`, extract the ID from the response body, and save it to `flowContext.createdQuoteId`.
3.  On the second step, `resolvePlaceholders` will see `{{flow.createdQuoteId}}` in the endpoint URL, look it up in the `flowContext`, and substitute it into the URL before making the request.
4.  On the third step, it will resolve both `{{flow.createdQuoteId}}` and `{{steps.create_quote_step.request.body.name}}` to build the new payload.

This creates a powerful, declarative way to define and execute complex end-to-end API scenarios.
